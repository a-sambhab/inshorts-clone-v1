                    World's richest person Jeff Bezos' upcoming flight to space is set to be the world's first unpiloted suborbital flight with an all-civilian crew. The four-person crew including Bezos will fly aboard Blue Origin's 60-foot-tall zNew Shepard spacecraft that is fully autonomous and cannot be piloted from inside. The 11-minute ride will take them above 100 km, or the Kármán line.

                    WhatsApp in its compliance report under the new IT rules revealed that it banned 20 lakh Indian accounts from May 15 to June 15. "Our top focus is preventing accounts from sending harmful or unwanted messages," WhatsApp said. It also clarified that over 95% of such bans are due to the unauthorised use of automated or bulk messaging (spam).

                    Wipro is likely to gradually begin calling employees to its offices from September this year as vaccination gains pace, depending upon the third wave of COVID-19, Chief Human Resources Officer Saurabh Govil said. "This will vary between country by country and different stages of the pandemic," he said. "This will not be one size fits all," Govil added.

                    WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that investigations into the origins of COVID-19 pandemic in China were being hampered by the lack of raw data on the first days of the spread there. He said, "We ask China to be transparent...and to cooperate." "We owe it to the millions who suffered and...millions who died to know what happened," he added.
